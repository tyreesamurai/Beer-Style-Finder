Australian RedBack

Category Wheat Beer
Recipe Type All Grain
7.75 lbs mix of 66% malted wheat extract and 33% barley
1 lbs crystal malt (steeped, removed before boil)
1 lbs amber unhopped dry malt extract

Hops
1.5 oz Kent Goldings hops (5.6% alpha) (60 minute
.5 oz Kent Goldings (10 minute boil)
.5 oz Kent Goldings (5 minute boil)
.5 oz Kent Goldings (in strainer, pour wort through)

Other
.5 oz Irish moss (15 minute boil)
.75 oz Burton water salts

Yeast 2 packs Doric ale yeast (started 2 hours prior to brew)
Procedure My primary ferment started in 1 hour and was surprisingly vigorous for 36 hours. It
finished in 48 hours. It has been fermenting slowly for 5 days and now has stopped blowing CO2
through the airlock at any noticeable rate (less than 1 bubble every 3--4 minutes) I took a
hydrometer reading last night and it read 1.018. This seems high for a F.G. in comparison to my
other beers of the same approximate S.G.
The last 1/2 ounce of hops was put in a strainer in a funnel and wort strained through it on its way
to the carboy, as described in Papazian. A blow-off tube was used.

Granolabrau
Category Pale Ale
Recipe Type All Grain
Fermentables
6 lbs 6-row cracked pale malt
1 lbs white or brown rice
1 lbs yellow corn grits or flaked maize
6 oz flaked barley
4 oz oatmeal
1.5 lbs clover or orange blossom honey

Other
4 oz millet

Yeast Wyeast German ale yeast (#1007)
Procedure Cook rice, grits, oatmeal and millet together in plenty of water for 3 hours to gelatinize.
The result should be a mushy, gummy mess.
Mash malt, barley and gelatinized grains in moderately hard water at 150F for 1-1/2 hours. Raise
to 168F to deactivate enzymes. Sparge with hot water (168F) to collect 250+ degrees of extract
(e.g., 6 gallons at S.G. 1.042).
Boil 1-1/2 hours, adding all but 1/2 ounce of hops after 1 hour, honey towards end of boil. Chill
wort and add cold water to bring S.G. to 1.050. Pitch with working starter. Dry-hop with reserved
hops in hopping bag. Primary fermentation takes 5-7 days. Wyeast 1007 will require 3-4 weeks in
secondary fermenter to settle out. Bottle, then age 2 months. Drink and enjoy!

1 lb Wheat malt (also for steeping)

Hops
1.5 oz Hallertauer Hops - I'm not a big hop fan, and this comes

Yeast Wyeast Bavarian wheat or German wheat yeast
Procedure For one I also added 5.5# frozen raspberries, though that started out almost like
raspberry soda, it mellowed well, though a bit tart. I also use honey for priming instead of
afterburner corn sugar. Steep the grains in a couple gallons of water over high temp. Strain out
just before it starts to boil. Add the Ireks and boil hops (and honey) boil for an hour, add finishing
hops last <10 minutes. I also use the Wyeast Barvarian Wheat (don't recall the #). It adds the
clove/banana flavor, but not too much, since its a mix of 2 strains. There's a couple other Wyeast
wheat strains, that vary in strength of cl ove/banana flavor, the German (#3333) leaning away
from the clove and banana. With the above recipe, and using the Barvarian Wheat, my first batch
was compared favorably by a friend to Spaten Hefeweisen, though I was a bit more critical of it ;).
Also, if you use the Wyeast, make a starter.

water and add malt extract. Bring to boil and add 1 ounce Fuggles. 20 minutes later add another
ounce. At the 40 minute mark, toss in the final half ounce of fuggles. (Almost threw in a full ounce,
but after tasting wort, decided against it---plenty bitter at this point.) Turn off heat and add
Cascades. Stirred down the hops slowly and let sit for about 10 minutes. Strain all into fermenter
containing ice water. Cooled. Pitched yeast. Single stage ferment. Keg, and age a few days.

Abbey Beer
Category Belgian Ale
Recipe Type All Grain
Fermentables
9 lbs U.S. 2-row
1.5 lbs Munich malt
0.5 lbs 60L (or darker) crystal malt
.5 oz of chocolate malt
1 lbs of honey or dark brown sugar

Hops
7 AAU bittering hops, a mix of hallertauer and kent goldings (60 minute boil)

Yeast Chimay yeast of course
Procedure Add hops at 60 minutes before end of boil. You are not looking for high hop bitterness,
nor should there be noticeable hop aroma.
If you're not an all-grain brewer, then don't use the 2-row or munich malt but use, say, 7 pounds
light, unhopped dry malt extract instead. Use crystal and chocolate malt for color. The honey or
brown sugar will boost the starting gravity as we ll as contribute to the flavor and body of the
finished beer. You might try doing the fermentation at a relatively "warm" temperature, say, 70 to
75 degrees F. This should lead to more of that Chimay flavor in the finished beer. And, don't drink
the beer all at once, as its flavor will evolve in the bottle over time.

1 oz. 3.5 alpha saaz dryhop in secondary

Other
2 tbsp of gypsum
.5 tsp Irish Moss fifteen minutes before end of boil
.5 c corn sugar to prime

Yeast wyeast London Ale Yeast
Procedure Put grains in 1.5 gal of water and bring to a boil. Remove grains, take pot off heat, and
add gypsum and malt extract. Stir well until extract is thoroughly disolved. Put back on heat and
bring to boil. Add Goldings. Wait thirty minutes and add fuggles. Wait fifteen minutes and add
irish moss. Wait another five minutes and add tetnanger. Wait five minutes more and add Saaz.
Cool when hour is up and sparge into fermenter. Pitch yeast. Rack after four days and dryhop for
three weeks in secondary.
This beer should be fermented between sixty five and seventy degrees. You want some esters in
an ESB for complexity. The chocolate malt will give the beer a ro asted taste in the background. I
do not call this an english ESB because of the german and czech hops used for flavoring and
aroma but it's every bit as tasty.

Yeast Dry Champagne Yeast (secondary)
Procedure The amount of grain here maxed out my bucket tun sparger. The alcohol here is only
about 9%, but then I sparged only enough water to accumulate about 6 gallons for the boil.
Sparging for an 8 or 9 gallons and then reducing to around 6 gallons when adding the hops
should add a boost to the alcohol content. Also, the Irish ale yeast brought the fermentation down
to the final gravity. The champagne yeast brought no further fermentation and could be
eliminated. Brewed as a single decoct. Strike temp of 144. Main mash at 154.

1 oz Goldings, Fuggles, Cascade, or Willamette whole hops

Other
1/3 oz Burton water salts
5--1/2 Gal water

Yeast Wyeast #1028 "London Ale" yeast
Procedure Steep the crushed crystal malt in a grain bag in the water as you bring it from cold to
170F, then remove. Don't boil the grains! I use two polyester hop bags, one for each addition, to
simplify removing the hops after the boil. The wort must be cooled to 70 or 80F before aeration. I
use an immersion chiller, which brings it from 212F to 70F in 15 minutes, and then pour the beer
through a large funnel into the fermenter on top of the yeast. I recommend the blowoff method of
fermentation---non-blowoff versions of this beer have tasted harsh, astringent and too bitter.
Primary fermentation: 3 weeks in glass at 66F. Dryhops added directly into fermenter (no hop
bag) after kraeusen falls (about 4-6 days). No secondary. Boil the priming extract in 16 ounces of
water for 15 minutes to sanitize.

Other
.5 tsp Burton water salts
.25 tsp Irish Moss (15 minutes)
.5 cup corn sugar for priming

Yeast 8 ounces starter from Wyeast #1028
Procedure Start with 5--1/2 gallons tap water. Steeped crushed crystal malt in a grain bag while
the liquor and Burton water salts went from tapwat er temperature up to 165F. Removed grain bag
and let wort drain out of it. After boiling down to 5 gallons, OG was 1071, so I added an additional
1/2 gallon of boiled water (not a big deal, but hop utilization would have been different with a 6
gallon boil). By the way, Chicago water is quite soft---I suspect distilled would be close enough.
Fermentation in glass, with blowoff, at 68F. Dryhops simply stuffed into the primary after
fermentation ended, seven days before bottling.

Alt
Category German Ale
Recipe Type All Grain
German ales include: Alt (Dusseldorf), Kolsch (Koln) and Weizens (Bavaria). Alt is made from the
German Ale yeast and then cold conditioned for up to four weeks. These ales are usually
fermented at colder temps than British ones (55 fahrenheit) The longer cold maturation yields a
smoother, cleaner ale than the British ones.

Hops
2 oz Perle hops (boil 60 minutes)
1 oz Perle (boil 30 minutes)

Other
Pale malt 90% of mash
Crystal malt 7% of mash
Wheat malt 3--10% of mash (vary percents accordingly)

Procedure I mashed (single infusion) at 152F for 1.5 hours. Primary fermented at around 55-60F
for 6 days. I split the batch after the primary - put 1 gallon in my fridge at around 38F for two
weeks, while the other 4 gallons sat in a carboy in my basement at around 70F. The beer was
very spicy (from the 1007?) at first, but mellowed out nicely after about 4 weeks. The cold-
conditioned gallon was smoother, and more drinkable at an earlier age (~2 weeks after bottling)
than the warm-conditioned portion. The cold-conditioned beers were also *brilliantly clear*! It was
perfectly balanced (to me), with a complex maltiness that I haven't had in any of my past beers.
The IBU's were around 36, using Tinseth's calculator. The color was perfect (dark copper?),
though the alcohol was probably a bit on the high side for the style.

American Pale Ale

Yeast Wyeast American ale yeast
Procedure "Dry hopping" consists of adding hops not  to the boil but after boil and especially after
fermentation. When your beer is done fermenting, you must rack it into a second sanitized vessel,
preferably a glass carboy for which you have a fermentation lock. The beer and the hops are both
added to that second vessel, and the beer is left from 1 to 3 weeks in the vessel. It isn't
fermenting, but it's picking up flavors from the hops. If you don't want to do this, then instead of
dry-hopping, add that last hop addition 2 minutes until end of boil. When you turn the flame off, let
the beer sit with the lid on for 20 minutes before chilling it and racking it into the fermenter. But, I
recommend that you try dry hopping sooner or later, as it adds flavor and aroma that is just right
for this beer! English Pale Ale (previous recipe) also benefits from dry hopping.

Anchor Liberty Clone
Category India Pale Ale
Recipe Type Extract

Fermentables
6 lbs. Northwestern Pale liquid extract
.5 lbs. . Crystal 40L

Hops
3 oz. Cascade (whole leaf) 5.5%, 60min (Partial Boil)
1 oz. Cascade (whole leaf) dry hop , one week

Other
1 tsp. gypsum
1 tsp Irish Moss

Yeast Wyeast London
Procedure If I were to use only 1/2 oz. dry hop I think they would be identical.
Primary ferment was one week at 68 degrees. Secondary ferment was one week.
For the dry hop I just threw them in the secondary. The hops float so you can siphon from
underneath them. The longer you dry hop the more the hops get "water logged" and start to sink.
You may want to try 5 days instead of 7. When I transferred it to the bottling bucket I did get some
hops in there. Wracking to a second bottling bucket might help but I was to lazy.
I did waste a little more beer than usual during bottling trying to avoid the hops. It is worth the
extra effort to use whole hops. The hop nose is awsome.
If you do a full boil, you may want to cut back on the bittering

Angie's Ale
Category Brown Ale
Recipe Type Extract
I just cracked open a bottle of my homebrew batch number 3. It's only been in the bottle since last
Saturday, so it's not quite carbonated all the way yet, but damn this beer turned out great.
I have been slowy making my batches more complex. I added some Crystal Malt grain to this
batch. It added some really nice flavor to the beer. While my first two batches turned out pretty
good. They lacked the character the grain added to this batch.
If there are any extract brewers out there who haven't tried adding a pound of grain to their
brews, I highly recommend you give it a try. It's not very difficult. You need not mash to add a
nice grain taste to your beer. Just make some grai n tea, but don't boil the grain or you will leach
nasties out of the grain husks. Yank the grain at about 160 F.
Here's my recipe for batch number 3. Suds rates it as a Flanders Brown Ale (Well Hi-dilly-ho
Neighbor!). I call it Angie's Ale (Angie is my border collie mix pup dog).

Fermentables
6 lb Light Liquid Malt Extract
1 lb Crystal Malt 60L
.75 cup Corn Sugar (priming)

Hops
2 oz Fuggles Hops (3.6% AA 30 min)
1 oz Willamette Hops (4.3% AA 10 min)

Other
5 gal Bottled Drinking Water
.5 tsp Non-Iodinized Salt

Yeast 1 pkt - Nottingham Dry Ale Yeast
Procedure Place Crystal Malt in a grain bag and heat with 2 gallons water in a pasta pot. Remove
grain at 160 F. Mix grain tea and Malt Extract in a cool brew pot, and add another gallon or two of
hot water. Bring to a boil add hops and salt. Cool wart. Rehydrate yeast, and pitch at 80 F.
Ferment in primary for 4 days at room temp. Rack to Secondary. Ferment for additional 10 days

Arizona Pale Ale
Category Pale Ale
Recipe Type Extract
I used hops for boiling (of course) and flavoring, not for aromatic qualities.

Fermentables
6-7 lbs pale malt extract
1 lbs Crystal malt, 1/2 pound toasted malted barley
2 cups steamed (sanatized) American Oak Chips (secondary)

Hops
2 oz Northern Brewer hops (boiling): 10HBU
1 oz Cascade hops (finishing)

Other
2 tsp. gypsum
1 tsp Irish Moss
.75 cups corn sugar (bottling)

Yeast 1 package Wyeast American Ale Liquid yeast (#1059)
Procedure If using Victory malt, toasting is not neccessary since it already is. If not, use standard
procedure for toasting grains--spread the grains  on a cookie sheet in a preheated oven, cook at
350 degrees for 10 minutes.
Combine all grains in a pot with 1 gallon water. I have found skipping a grain bag obtains a more
intense color. Hold at 150 degrees for 30 minutes.
In another pot, heat water for sparging, 1 gallon should do. Sparge grains into the brew pot.
I fetched my water from a local Water Mart. This is Reverse Osmosis (RO) water, and could be
too thin for a (India) Pale Ale. Thus, I add gypsum. I could have added Burton Water Salts at the
expense of quaffability.
Boil wort for 1 hour. Add the Cascade hops and Irish Moss after the boil and for 5-10 minutes to
sanatize, as well as obtain flavor instead of mearly imparting aroma.
I did not use a yeast started since the liquid American Ale yeast was less than one month old
when purchased.

Bah Humbug Brew

I used orange peel with good results once. I would like a litte more orange, so next time I think I
will add it to the beginning of the boil in a slightly lesser quantity.
Rapid start with the fermentation. Some may want more hops, I don't like my beer very bitter. This
is a great winter brew and has some residual sweetness. I love it while talking in front of the
fireplace. The flavour is very complex. I can taste orange and cranberry, but not sure about the
spice. Good body, little head, and does well with a month or two of aging. Got great reviews from
a the few that usually say,"I don't like beer very much"(referring to the garbage in the grocery
store no doubt)

Yeast London ale yeast
Procedure Mash schedule:
Mash-in with 10qts @ 42C for a strike temp of 39C
20 minute beta-glucan rest
Add 10 qts at 100C (boiling) to raise to 62C (aiming for 60C),
30 min. beta-amylase rest
Add 6 quarts @ 100C to raise to 67C (aiming for 70C)
1:15 alpha-amylase rest
Take first runnings (drain all liquid from mash tun without adding any further sparge water(*)) to
get about 4-4.5 gallons @ 1.080. Boiling down to 3 gallons will give an OG of 1.105 - 1.120.
Whirlpool, let settle for 15 minutes and siphon through counterflow chiller with aerating cane on
end.
Pitch yeast slurry from a previous batch of Mild (probably YeastLab London Ale (it's a long
story)). (By the way, this is my favorite way to pitch *enough* yeast for a barleywine.)
Fermentation was active in 2 hours. Primary was about 2 months @ 65-70F, and dropped from
1.105 to 1.038.
Rack into secondary and add 1 oz of EKG plugs for dry hopping.

Yeast 2 packs Munton & Fison ale yeast
Procedure We did a single stage fermentation, so I can't answer your question about how long to
age in secondary. We gave the finishing hops 10 minutes. As far as conditioning in bottles---well,
it's been 14 months now and it keeps getting better. At 2 months it was OK, but cloudy enough
that we thought we should have used gypsum. It was also VERY sweet, but also very hoppy and
quite smooth. By 9 months it was clear, but quite heavy and we thought maybe less sugar. Last
week it had gotten considerably drier and VERY clear. It's really good now, so I don't know if it'll
last long enough for me to give you an update later.

while adding runoff to brew kettle to get boiling. Sparge SG ran from 1.09 down to about 1.025
when I had enough wort. Added 3 lbs DME (Dark Australian) to bring wort to 1.06 SG. I added 8
oz. of lactose and a tsp. of dry moss before killing the fire. I pitched a large starter of the Irish
Wyeast strain and got lots of blow off. I had extra wort in a 4 liter auxillary. I used this to fill up the
secondary afer racking off the lees. Dry hopping was done in the secondary with the cascade.
After 2 weeks, the SG was only down to 1.03, and fermentation was very slow.

bittering hops is key; Bullion is lovely, as are Nugget or Chinook.
There are no appreciable differences between making stouts and other ales, save the larger
quantities of grain. Beware of 9-pound batches as these can blow the lids off fermenters.

Beginner's Luck Brown Ale
Category Brown Ale
Recipe Type Extract
Fermentables
4 lb malt extract syrup
6 oz crystal malt
1.5 oz black malt
2 oz roasted barley
1 oz flaked or rolled barley
1 oz wheat malt
28 oz dark brown sugar

Hops
2 oz Northern Brewer hops
1 oz Goldings hops

Other
2 oz lactose

Yeast ale yeast
Procedure Hops: these are two of the six or so types available here in the UK; I'm afraid I don't
know what the US equivalents would be because I've been brewing only since my transplantation
from the States in early '92. [If anyone knows a reasonable set of hops equivalencies, I`m all
ears.] Northern Brewer is a very sharp hop that is a prime-requisite for British dark beers and
stouts (and some pale ales); Goldings is a much "rounder" hop that is a prominent component of
southern-English bitters. US brewers use yer bes t guesses, I guess. Procedure: I treat my water
with 0.25 tsp salt per gallon to adjust pH; the water here (Bristol, in the SW) is fairly soft by UK
standards but contains some dissolved CaCO3. I have had no difficulties whatever using tap
water. I dissolve the malt extract and then boil the adjunct grains + hops in it for about an hour. I
then strain a couple of kettlesful (kettlefuls?) of hot water into the primary through the spent
grains and hops to rinse them. I dissolve the sugar in a couple of pints of warm water and add
this to the wort, then top up with cold water to 5 gallons. When the wort is cool, I then measure
OG (usually about 1035 to 1039), then add the lactose and pitch the (top-fermenting) yeast. The
lactose gives just a hint of residual sweetness in the final brew; if that's not to your taste, omit it.
This brew ferments to quarter-gravity stage in about 3 days when temperatures are about 20C
(70F) and in about 5 days when temps are about 10C (mid-40s F). Final gravity is usually about
1005, resulting in ABV's of 4.5 to 5%. I prime my sec ondary fermentation vessel with about 1 tsp
of dark brown sugar, and usually let it sit in the secondary 7 to 10 days, adding finings after the
first 48 hours or so. I have not tried dry-hopping this recipe. I prime my bottles with 1/2 tsp of

oz. S. Goldings for 40 min. 1/2 oz. Saaz for the final 3 min. -- Cool to pitching temperature(68-
70F) and pitch yeast starter. I racked this brew when primary fermentation was done and added
1/4 oz. of Saaz to the secondary (dry hop) and let sit for 2 weeks before bottling. Added 3/4 cup
of dextrose to prime. Make sure you let this beer condition in the bottle for at least 3 months
before sampling. Actually it gets better after 6 months in the bottle. By the way, this recipe is for 5
U.S. gallons and you may want to increase or decrease the amount of grains depending on the
efficiency of your system. My starting gravity was 1.068 and finished off at 1.012.( about 7.4%

Procedure Two-stage mash: 50 deg C. for 30 min., then 66 deg C. for 45 min.
The two-stage mash is because of the wheat malt component.
Fermented at cool room temperature (around 16 deg C.).
That's it. The light hopping is to let the wheat and yeast flavours shine through, and they do, very
nicely. Although this is an ale, I found it tasted best well-chilled. It also needed a little while (about
a month) in the bottle for the yeast and hop flavours to reach an optimum balance.

The blueberries were crushed prior to adding to wort. They were added to wort after the end of
boil, when temperature of wort was lower than 180F. The blueberries were allowed to sit in hot
wort for 15 minutes. The wort was then chilled with an immersion chiller. Then, the whole
shebang (fruit, hops, and all) were poured into a plastic fermenter for primary fermentation.
Primary done for seven days, following which the beer was racked off of the gunk into glass. I
think I left it in the glass for two days; fermentation was pretty much complete. Oh -- a tsp. of
polyclar added 24 hours prior to bottling.

Black Betty
Category Stout
Recipe Type All Grain
.
Fermentables
13.0 Lbs 2-row barley
2.0 Lbs white wheat
1.0 Lbs crystal 20L
1.0 Lbs black patent

Hops
2.0 Oz magnum ~ 15%

Yeast Nottingham Dry Yeast
Procedure This is a single step infusion. Allocate the correct amount of water into the pot and
dissolve the gypsum into it. I then heat the water to approximately 150 F and add the grains,
stirring to achieve a mixture. Then I place the pot (make sure it will fit) into a preheated oven set
at about 165 F. Mash for about 1 hour. Note that the times are approximate and that you are
controlling it, checking and stirring every 20 minutes or so. Sparge using hot water in the correct
amount so that husk tannins are not extracted. Boil with all hops for about 45 minutes. Cool
slightly, and split between primary fermenters. Top off with good drinking water. Once the wort
cools to yeast friendly temperature, pitch the y east and ferment. Only primary ferment for at least
two weeks, to allow the high gravity to render into alcohol. Bottle as usual and try to keep your
sweaty paws off until it matures. Enjoy.

Bob's Sandia Pale Ale
Category Pale Ale
Recipe Type Extract


Fermentables
6 lbs light dry malt extract
1 lb carapils malt
.25 cup malto dextrine

Hops
1 oz northern brewers pellets (boil)
2 oz cascade plugs (aroma and dry hop)

Yeast 2/3 cup dextrose and small amount of any brewers yeast for prime and bottle
Procedure Start wyeast in usual fashion (at least 24 hrs prior). Steep grains at 158F for 15min in
1 gallon water, sparge with 1 gallon ~170F. Start boil with this original 2 gallons add DME, malto
dextrine, and northern brewers pellets, boil 45 min, add 1/2 oz cascade, boil 10 more minutes
then add another 1/2 oz cascade and turn off heat. Let sit 5 minutes, cool and add to ~3.5 gallons
for a total volume 5 - 5.5 gallons. Pitch yeast (should be ~ 1 liter of starter).
Note this yeast (wyeast 1968) activity is low and very  little carbon dioxide is given off. This yeast
is very flocculant and it will leave bottled beer flat, so just add a small amount of any other yeast
with the dextrose at bottling to get good carbonation, however it produces a very smooth
character to the brew that makes it worth using.
Primary fermentation is complete in 4 days. Ra ck to secondary and add 1/2 cascade (dry hop).
Bottle after ~ 7 days in secondary using 2/3 cup dextrose, and being careful to add additional
yeast a 1/4 tsp of any dry yeast is plenty.

Procedure Boil the Hallertau Hops for at least 10 minutes then remove from heat and add the
Saaz Hops and cover and leave for a further 10 mi nutes. Add to fermenter with 2 cans of lager
malt extract. I have found that even "No Name" brands  of extract work well in this recipe due to
the fact that the hops are up front and in your face. (If you use the unhopped light malt extract
then increase the amount of hops you add by 50%) This recipe works nice in bottles but I prefer it
kegged.

Brown Ale
Category Brown Ale
Recipe Type Extract
When I'm looking for a batch with a quick turn around, it's time to whip up this Brown Ale recipe.
It's ready to drink within 3 weeks and excellent within the month.
Fermentables
1 Lb. Special 'B' malt (VERY dark Crystal)
6 Lbs. Amber malt syrup
.75 cup corn sugar boiled in 2 cups water for priming

Hops
1 oz. Fuggles hop pellets - 45 minutes
.5 oz. Fuggles hop pellets - 5 minutes

Yeast Wyeast 1084 - Irish Ale yeast
Procedure Add the grains to the cold water in the pot, heat nearly to boiling (180-190 degrees),
remove and sparge with more hot water (I use the tea kettle and a SS colander). Bring to a boil,
turn off heat and add malt syrup and dissolve (this is to avoid burning it to the bottom of the pot).
Bring back to a boil, add the boiling hops, and after 40-45 minutes add the finishing hops.
Remove from heat, cool (I put the whole pot in an ice water bath), transfer to carboy and top up to
5 gallons if needed. Pitch yeast, mix and aerate thoroughly.
Fermentation should be done in a week, but I leave it sit for another just to be sure. After bottling
it should be carbonated and tasty in another week.
My water is fairly hard so a dose of brewing salts might also be in order.

This beer tastes fine. It is brown, malty, and slightly bitter. I don't get much nutty flavor, so I would
increase the chocolate malt.
Fermentables

Recipe Type Extract
.
Fermentables
.25 lbs choc. malt
.5 lb. De Wolf-Cosyns special B malt
6 lb. amber syrup (I used Briess)
2 lb. dark syrup

Hops
1 oz. Northern Brewer hops (boiling)
.5 oz. fuggle hops (finishing)

Other
.5 lb. Briess special roast
.75 cup corn sugar to prime

Yeast European Ale yeast
Procedure In case your homebrew store doesn't have the secific brands of grains I listed here--
the "special roast" is toasted barley, about 50 Lov ibond, and the "special B" is a very dark crystal
malt--221 Lovibond. If it's not available, substitute in the darkest crystal malt you can find.
You asked for specific directions, so here goes:
1) heat about 2 gal of water in your brewpot. Steep the choc malt, special B, and special roast
while the water heats up. Putting the grains in a msulin steeping bag helps make removing the
grains a lot easier.
2) When the water begins boiling, remove the gr ains, and add the amber syrup, dark syrup, and
Northern Brewer hops.
3) After 50 min, throw in the fuggle hops, and boil for 10 more minutes.
4) Cool down your wort, and add to your carboy with 3 gal water. When it's all reahced 78F, pitch
your yeast.

worried.
Sparge as usual. Add sucanat and boil 60 minutes.
Chill as usual. The original gravity comes to 1.048 (for 5 gallons).
Pitch London Ale or German Ale Wyeast. Actually, I'm going to try the California Steam/Lager

Other
4 oz. DWC Aromatic

Yeast yeast cultured from Black Butte Porter
Procedure Mash with 1 quart/pound. Strike water: 2.5 gallons of 170F water. Add 0.5 gallons
boiling water to raise mash to 158F. Recirculated 4 quarts of mash, then drained 4 quarts of
mash and heated to boil. Returned to mash for mashout. Sparge with 5 gallons water.
Once boil is established, begin hop schedule. I added two quarts distilled water 30 minutes into
the boil (it was a warm day and the boil was rolling nicely). I added my immersion chiller with 30
minutes remaining. After cooling, I added 1/2 teaspoon HopTech Foam control to a sanitized 6
gallon carboy, then carefully poured the cool wort through a stainless steel strainer nested in a
large funnel. After chilling the wort further in a water bath to 58F, I aerated the wort using an
aquarium pump, 0.22 micron filter, and aquarium airstone for 30 minutes.
The yeast, which came from a bottle of Black Butte Porter, was stepped up to a 2000ml starter. I
think the fermentation temperature might have been too cold (60F) because it took almost 36
hours to reach active fermentation. Temperture was maintained at 60F for seven days, then

racked to secondary, where temperature was allowed to stabilize at 65F for two weeks. Bottled
using 5/8 cups corn sugar. Allow at least four weeks in the bottle to condition before taste testing.

3.3 lb American Classic Amber extract syrup
3 lb Dutch DME (I don't know the brand, but it is high in dextrins)
.5 lb brown sugar
.5 inch brewers licorice

Hops
1 oz Brewers gold (8.5 %alpha) hops - bittering

Other
2 oz fresh grated ginger
3 oz unsweetened bakers chocolate
1 tsp Irish moss

Yeast 2 pkg dry whitbread yeast
Procedure 5Q mash water, 2 1/2 (?) G Sparge water mash in at 138F, brought to 155F for 1 hr.,
mash out at 168F
Added extracts and sugar and brought to boil. Added the ginger, licorice, chocolate, and hops
after boil started. I was afraid that the chocolate would burn on the bottom of the boiler, so I set
each 1 oz piece on my stiring spoon and dipped gently in the wort until they melted.
The real interesting thing about the brew was that after pitching, a thick bubbly layer of stuff
formed on the surface of the beer in the carboy almost immediately after fermentation started,
and never left, even after I expected the Kraeusen to fall. There was the usual amount of activity
in the beer, but never more than an inch of Kraeusen.
The good thing was that after racking to my secondary carboy, I left most of the stuff that was
sitting on the surface in my primary, and almost all of the rest in my secondary when I racked to
my bottling bucket.

I primed with amber DME, and the results even after only two weeks are wonderful, however
there is still a small layer of this sediment even in the bottle at the surface of the beer.

Now, I know boiling fruit releases the pectin, but I couldn't figure a way around the need to both
pasteurize the berries and to break the skin. However, I can't detect any negative influences in
my beer. By using a two stage fermentation, I was able to siphon off the beer and leave all the
fruit pulp behind. The only thing really missing from the beer is a hop aroma - the H-T hops were
just too mild for the cranberries....

Corn Beer

Fermentables
5 lbs cracked corn, sold as bird food
8 lbs light barley malt
.5 lb Crystal (40L.)

Hops
4 oz whole Hallertau

Yeast yeast from the bottom of a Saisson Dupont bottle
Procedure Mash corn at 110, for an hour, then 140 for another hour. Stir lots, since its sticky.
Mash malted barley as usual at 110, 148, 140, 160. I used a separate pot for the 110 1/2 hour
protein rest, and then just tossed into the corn grits.
Mash water was around 26-30 quarts. Sparge to about 6 gallons after at least 3 hours in the 140-
160 range.
Hops to taste, depending on what you're making. The yeast from the bottom of a Saisson Dupont
bottle really does well with the corn content, but make sure you like that kind of beer first. 4 oz
whole Hallertau for 7 gallons of wort sounds about right, but hey, adjust to your tastes.

.75 cup brown sugar for priming

Yeast Munton & Fison Dry Ale yeast
Procedure I used a little under 3 pounds of frozen cranberries and pureed them right before
adding to the wort right after turning off the heat. Their semi-frozen state brought the boil straight
down. I had a strainer over the funnel hole and would let the wort drip through it. Then I would
press it a bit with the ladling spoon and scoop it out into a bowl. This took a little while, and some
of the wort was left behind in the saturated cranberries (I used hop bags and grain sacks so that
there wasn't a lot of other stuff). But I topped it off with some tap water (gasp!) and got a nice two
cases out of it.

pot along with enough water to fill it 2/3 full (No more than 3 1/2 gals.) and boil for 45 mins. 30
mins before end of boil, add boiling hops and Irish moss. Add finishing hops 5 mins. before end of
boil. Upon completion, place in primary fermentation container, add water to 4-4.25 gals. and
allow to cool to 150 deg F. Add six cans of the Raspberry Nectar, cover and allow to cool to body
temp before pitching yeast. After a couple of days, when the head subsides, add the other five
cans of raspberry concentrate. (It really likes to go out the top at this stage.) In two or three more
days, the head should again subside, at which time it should be racked into a glass carbouy with
a minimum of head space. Follow the progress of fermentation. When the ring of bubbles
dissappears at the neck of the carbouy, it is time to bottle. Rack and combine with 3/4 cup of corn
sugar (dissolved in a minimum of boiling water) and bottle. It should be ready in three to four
weeks from bottling time, which makes it the fastest wine that I've ever made, if it can be said to
be such. Personally, I think it's the best too.

Procedure This, along with a 90-minute boil, gave me the medium-amber color I was looking for.
Time will tell if the crystal and chocolate will give the beer an undesirable harshness. I think you'd
want a fairly soft finish in any weizen. I've tried this year's SA Summer Wheat (Dunkelweizen) and
I think it's too harsh, as well as under-carbonated. The color's right, though.

and pitched about 1/2 gallon starter)

Yeast ale yeast (I used Mendocino from a bottle of "Eye of the Hawk"
Procedure Boil was about 3 gallons with extract, grain broth, honey and maltose. Pitched @ 76 F
(used an immersion chiller). Initial fermentation was very fast - within only 3 days the krausen had
fallen and within 5 days there was almost no bubbling from the airlock. Racked to secondary and
dry hopped. Secondary was very slow, and took 3 weeks to stabilize SG. I had heard that
Mendocino yeast is not a great attenuator, and also the English DME finishes higher than
American, but this is only 69% apparent attenuation. This gives an actual attenuation of 57%.
Wow!
I was originally going to prime with gyle but there were too many variables on this one so I
chickened out and primed with corn sugar -- at this point I didn't want to risk screwing up my
Christmas beer, and such a great one at that. [Next time Spencer, I promise!] Primed for a total of
2.2 volumes CO2 using 3.5 oz corn sugar.

English Pale Ale
Category Pale Ale
Recipe Type Extract
.
Fermentables
4--1/2 lbs unhopped light dry malt extract
.5 lbs dark crystal malt
.5 lbs dark brown sugar

Hops
1 oz Kent Goldings hops (60 minute boil)
.5 oz Fuggles hops (boil 60 minutes)
.5 oz Fuggles (boil 30 minutes)
.5 oz Kent Goldings (10 minute boil)
.5 oz Kent Goldings (2 minute boil)

Other
1 tsp gypsum or Burton salts

Yeast Whitbread ale yeast (or Munton & Fison or Brewers Choice)
Procedure Notice that the recipe calls for unhopped, light, dry malt extract. Use unhopped extract
because you're going to add your own hops. Use li ght- colored extract because you're going to
get some color from the crystal malt. Use dry malt because you can measure it out, unlike syrups.
The crystal malt should be cracked. Your homebr ew supply store can do that for you. Steep the
crystal malt for 30 minutes in your water at 150 degrees F. Then strain the husks out, bring the
water to boil, add the gypsum or salt, and add the dry malt. After the wort has been boiling for 10
minutes, add the first hops and follow the hop schedule indicated above. Hops are English hops.
Brown sugar can be added as soon as the boil  starts. If you use dry packaged yeast, use the
above brands. Others are lousy! If you like the recipe, vary only the yeast, and you get a
somewhat different beer next time! Whitbred dry yeast and Wyeast "British" ale are the same
yeast.

0.5 oz. Cascade @8
1-1/2 oz Cascade (dry hop)
.5 oz Nugget (dry hop)

Yeast Wyeast 1028 London Ale
Procedure I used 1 qt of water per lb of grain (7 qts total, soft, pre boiled seattle water with 2 tsp
of Gypsum) I used a short 20 minute protein rest and a long 2 hr mash @156F for some residual
body and sweetness in the finished beer.
I only collected about 4.5 galons of wort because I don't have a big enough brew pot. I was within
a point or two of my target OG based on my assumed efficiency of 85% of Dave Miller's optimal
numbers. I boiled about 3.5 gal wort with the hops in a 4 gal pot. In another pot I boiled the
remaining sweet wort and added it to the main pot as space became available.
All hops were whole hops from the Hop Source (good hops, good prices, no financial or personal
interest). I adjusted my IBU calculations for the estimated SG in the main pot. I assumed a more-
or-less linear increace in SG between the SG at the start of the boil and the estimated SG at the
time I added all runnings to the main pot. When calculating the IBUs for the early additions I did
not try to take into account the dramatic boost in OG over the last 25 minutes of the boil caused
by the addition of the LME.

I cooled the wort over 40 minutes time in a covered kettle in a tub-full of cold water. Yeast was
pitched at about 75F. Fermenation proceeded at 60F . Racked to carboy after 5 days, dry hopped

.5 pound, cara-pils malt

Hops
4 oz Saaz Hops (60 min before end of boil)

Yeast Wyeast Bohemian lager #2124 or Munich lager #2308
Procedure Each recipe assumes 75% extract efficiency. Use the best German or Belgian pilsner
malt you can find, rather than U.S. 2-row or U.S. 6-row malt. Likewise, use German or Belgian
Munich malt if you can find it. In the recipes, the crystal malt and Munich malt impart some color,
but otherwise will have slightly different flavoring properties.
Add hops following traditional German hop schedule: 2 ounces of Saaz 60 minutes before end of
boil, 1 ounce 30 minutes before end of boil, and 1 ounce in last 10 minutes of boil. You could
probably hop a bit more agressively than indicated. You might make a final aroma addition of
another 0.5-1 ounce of Saaz right before end of boil. You also might consider dryhopping.
Water should be soft.
For starch conversion, aim at 153-4 degrees F for 90 minutes.
Pilsner Urquell cold-conditions for months, so you might try an extended lagering

Yeast Edme dry ale yeast (forgot to start the Wyeast English Ale)
Procedure I did the usual procedure of bringing 2-gal of water to a high-but-not-boiling
temperature (I have no thermometer), and steeped the crushed crystal malt for 30 min, then
strained out. I then upped the heat to a boil, added the DME and stirred to dissolve. Then, I
added the boiling hops. Boiled 1 hour uncovered. I added the flavor hops, boiled 10 min, covered,
then added aroma hops, boiled 2 min, removed from heat. I skimmed out the hops, ran the hot
wort through my chiller into my primary, and diluted to 5 gal. Then, I pitched the hydrated Edme
yeast.
I racked to a secondary after seven days, and gave it a 2-week secondary fermentation. I primed
with 3/4 cup of M&F light DME and bottled.

1 tsp of Irish Moss

Yeast Kolsch Wyeast
Procedure The .25lb. crushed wheat grain was placed in a grain bag, put in the cold water (2.5
gallons), and raised to 165 degrees where it steeped for 10 minutes. I then raised the it to a boil,
added the boiling hops (the Northern) and the DME. After 60 minutes I added the flavor hops (.75
oz. of the spalt and 1.25 oz. of the Hallertau) and 1 teaspoon of Irish Moss. I then let this boil for
15 minutes (75 minutes total).
I then put in my primary and added the Kolsch Wyeast (liquid, natch). This is an interesting yeast.
I let it ferment at around 62-64 for about 1 1/2 weeks, until it seemed just about done. I then threw
it into the fridge at 42 degrees for about 2 weeks. When I took it out, the yeast appeared upset by
the sudden temperature change and it fermented rather energetically for about 1/2 day or so, and
then it slowed down. I toook a specific gravity and it was 1.08. Done. (I screwed up the starting
gravity. Ooops).
I primed and bottled. Let it sit for two weeks, then placed it in the fridge. Let it sit in teh fridge
about 1 week before drinking, and MMMMMMMMMMMM.....good stuff.

First All Grain
Category Pale Ale
Recipe Type All Grain

Fermentables
6 lbs Klages [I would boost this to 8+. --Ed.]
1 lb Crystal malt
1 lb light DME (due to low extraction rate) [...and drop this.]
1 oz Chocolate malt

Hops
1 oz Hallertauer 8.5% for boiling
1 oz Cascade 3% last 10 min of boil

Other
1 tsp Irish Moss (last 15 min.. Didn't re-hydrate)

Yeast 20 oz of starter. Wyeast #1028 (pack was over a year old and took 6 days
Procedure I used about 3 gallons of mash wa ter making for a soupy mash. Boosted the
temperature of the mash to 155 without any protei n rest. I had used about 3 teaspoons of gypsum
to get the mash down to a PH of about 5.0.
Put in insulated box for 2 1/2 hours. Ending temp was 145. The requirement was for two hours,
but getting the sparge water ready took longer than I wanted. Then I boosted to 168 degrees for
mash-out. (iodine test showed complete conversion).
For the sparge water, I used an 8% Phosporic acid solution to acidify 6 gallons of hot tap water.
After 2 tsps, my PH strips looked like they were still above 6.0. Then, on the 3rd teaspoon, the PH
abruptly changed, and the test strips remained yellow, indicating that it was now very acidic. I had
to add about 3 more gallons of water before it got back up to about 5.0.
I was expecting just a slow trickle for the sparge, but once I opened the spigot on my lauter tun,
the wort hissed out. (Used the cylindrical cooler with sparge bag on SS vegetable strainer) It
never did slow to a trickle as I was expecting. I slowed the flow of the output and input so that the
sparge would take about an hour. (The water was 168 degrees, Re-circulated 1st runnings until
clear) NOTE: I don't think the water was leaking thru the sides of the sparge bag, and it looked
like it *was* filtering through the grain bed OK, which was always held in suspension.
-----
- 226 -

Collected about 8 gallons of wort (ph of the runnings never dropped below 5.8 even though the
gravity dropped to about 1.010) and boiled for 90 minutes. A gravity reading before the boil
showed only about 1.020 (granted, it was 8 gallons) prompting me to add 1 lb DME. I thought I
had boiled down to 5 gallons, but was actually 6. (Hav en't put any sort of volume markings in my
Sankey keg boiler yet). Used a CF chiller, shook the 6 1/2 gal car-boy for about 5 minutes to
oxygenate and pitched yeast. FG was only 1.032 at 60 deg F.

small pots so I had to use 4 of them to hold and boil all of the wort. I also split up the hops
between the pots so they all got some. I chilled with my new immersion chiller thanks to a none

1 tbs CaCO3
Irish Moss - 30 min

Yeast Liquid Irish Ale yeast
Procedure I cracked the grains using my food processor in short bursts (worked great!).
Transferred them to a mesh strainer and shook to remove dust. I did this outside so as not to
contaminate the kitcken. These were then placed with the oats (unground) into a grain bag. I
preheated a 10 qt. (12-pack) cooler with boiling water, added the grain bag and 175 deg. water.
Water cooled to the target of 160 deg. and steeped for 15 minutes. Things were working
beautifully. I boiled the water and added the extract, CaCO3 and the steep liquor. This is where I
have the question.
In previous extract/grain batches I have steeped grains, then washed them in some of the
unboiled water until the water ran "clear." I started to do this with the black/chocolate malts but
obviously with the black grains it wouldn't have run clear. Eventually, the water I was using
started to become the consistancy of thin syrup. If I continued to wash them I would have been
there for days until the liquid began to thin and probably would have ended up with 10 gallons of
wort.

Procedure Add 1.5 gallons cold water and the grains (in a bag) to your boiling pot. Spend about
30 mins bringing the water to a boil. I use medium high on my generic electric range, high boils
too quickly and doesnt give the grains enough soaking time.
Remove the grain bag just before the water boils.
Remove the pot from the heat (to prevent scorching) and add the extract.
Replace on the heat and add 3/4 oz chinook hops - boil for 60 min.
Add 1 oz cascades for the last 15 minutes of the boil.
Cool to about 100F (chiller, ice bath, snow drift or divine intervention) Add cooled wort to 3
gallons cold water in your primary fermenter.
When the temp is less than 80F (should be by now) add the yeast and shake the snot out of it,
um, I mean, aereate the wort.

Procedure We did a beta glucan rest at 120 degrees for 30 mins, a protein rest at 130 degrees for
30 mins, and a saccrafication rest at 155 for 1 hour. Be extra careful with the sparge because it
has the potential to be very slow (although we managed to whip right through in 45 mins.). We
boiled the wort for 2 hours, leaving the hops in for the entire boil. Cooled with an immersion chiller
to 42 degrees and strained into a carboy. After 8 hours we racked the wort off of the trub and
pitched the yeast. We left it in primary for 2 weeks and then racked it into a carboy and added the
raspberries.

Yeast Wyeast London Ale (1028) yeast
Procedure There is no Fuggles in ESB or any of the Fullers beers. They use English Target,
Challenger and Northdown. EKG is in the finish & cask hopping of both Chiswick Bitter (very good
bitter) and ESB. BTW the kettle hops are Lupofresh( challenger, 91) pellets from Kent and
Worscester. They "Burtonize" the brewing water using mineral salts. A single temp infusion is
employed. The ESB is 1.052 OG (a pparently this was reduced for the US market, according to a
brewer I was drinking with in the Pub next door). I was told they used to use sugar but this is no
longer required with the new mash tuns. I missed out on the Maize part so I do not know, but I
assume George has this correct. Try 5- 10 % in the mash. Skip the sugar, use caramel malts to
get the color and sweetness.

So far so good, eh? This was a fantastic beer even before I carbonated it. But you asked for
jalapenos, so here goes...
Added 10.5 ounces chopped jalapenos into the secondary. Next morning, Gerry noticed spots of
mold on top, so kegged, carbonated, and tasted...
...HOT! But it really does taste like a good beer too.
Peppers mellowing day by day. Should be outstanding in 2 weeks if the mold doesn't come back.
And guess what? The mold didn't come back, and the beer was well received by all. Be advised,
it was HOT AS HELL! If I ever brew something like this again, I'll use one can (3.5 ounces) of

This process took about 10 hours from start to clean up excluding pre-boiling the water. I am
quite happy with this beer. It has a smoothnes that I have not tasted with my other Hefe Weizen's
that I attribute to the unhopped speise. I found Eric Warner's book quite helpful and pretty much
followed his guidelines verbatim. I was surprised at the very easy sparge. I did stir after one hour
and recirc 1/2 gallon. The run-off was clear and I had no stuck mash problems.

Procedure: I don't like the flavor IrishMoss adds to beer so I don't use it, but the finished beer is
definitely clearer if you do use it. Heavy boil - 30min Heavy boil - 45min (7g hop added at
beginning of second boil) Rest(no heat) - 30min Cool as quickly you possible can. I use a
homebuilt refrigeration system that cools the wort to roughly 50degF faster than I can gravity
drain. Pitch yeast and allow fermentation to begin before adding 1g hop for dry hopping. Primary
fermentation is usually complete within 7 days. Transfer to secondary fermenter for 7 more days.
Rack to bottles priming for roughly 2.5-2.6Vol store for about 30 to 160days. The oats contribute
a large amount of fat to the final product. Waiting longer than 160 days to drink the final product
begins to decline. Wort flow benefits from adding 1cup Rice Hulls to mash just prior to sparging.

Procedure I have a 10 gallon Gott cooler with a Phil's Phalse bottom. I added 3.0 gallons of
54degC water to the crushed grains and stabilized the temp at 50degC for 30 minutes. Then I
added 1.0 gallons of boiling water along with the pureed pumpkin (heated to around boiling) and
got the temp of the mash to 65degC. I held this temp in the cooler for just under 90 minutes.
Iodine test confirmed starch conversion. I added 1 gallon of boiling water to mash out, let the
grain bed sit undisturbed for 10 minutes, gently recirculated about several quarts of the runnings,
then sparged with 4-4.5 gallons of 77degC water over a period of about 40 minutes. I collected 7
gallons (just about all my pot will hold). After the sparge, I measured the gravity and got a
temperature corrected value of 1.042.

Other
2 Tbs Cinnamon
2 Tbs Allspice
2 Tbs Cloves
1 Tbs Nutmeg

Yeast 1 pkg Whyeast Scottish Ale liquid yeast
Procedure Put the grains in a BIG grain bag so they have plenty of room to allow water to flow
between after they swell up. Put the grain bag in the cold water and bring the heat up to 160
degrees F. "Steep" the grains like a big teabag. Mix the grains around by squishing the outside of
the bag with a spoon, lift the bag out to drain the water with the goodies into the pot. Mix squish
and drain the stuff every 5 minutes for an hour. DON'T let the temperature exceed 170 degrees F
during the steep to keep tannin extraction (creates a bitter flavor, especially with roasted and
black grains) to a minimum. Pull out the grains and set them in a colander that hangs in the rim of
your pot and pour a half gallon of clean water through them (preferred), or put them in a colander
in a bowl so you can capture the stuff that runs out and add it back to your boil.
-----
- 288 -
I use pellet hops. Keep them in the fridge and use them as soon as possible. When done
steeping the grains I add the first batch of hops (1 oz for this beer) and bring the water to a boil.
Turn off the burner, add the Malt extract and stir it in till completely dissolved. Turn the heat back
on, bring to a boil and check the clock. Depending on style you'll add different hops at different
times. This recipe calls for 1 oz Perle at 60 minutes and 1 oz Perle at 30 min. You put the 60 min
oz in first, then when there is 30 min left to the boil you add the second oz (add the spices here
and maple syrup at end of boil for this beer). Boiled hops add the bittering character, some
recipes call for hops at end of boil (sometimes called knockoff) which add aromatic character,
some at transfer to secondary which really contributes to herbal or floral aromatics. A note
regarding the boil, though a watched pot never boils, an unwatched pot of boiling wort will boil
over - WATCH IT.
Cooling and Transferring to Primary: Folks use all kinds of containers and techniques to cool and
ferment, its a matter of choice. This is what I do. Transfer the pot to my kitchen sink, fill the sink
with ice and cold water. Put 2 gallons of fermentation temp water (yes I chill water for lagers, I
have been called compulsive) in a sanitized bottling bucket. Add the wort when it is cooled to
fermentation temp and add water to 5 gallons (measure and make gallon marks on the outside of
your bucket using tap water). I fill the bucket to about 1/2 inch above the 5 gal mark because the
valve at the bottom of the bucket is about 1/2 inch above the bottom. Let it set for 30 minutes for
solids to settle to the bottom of the bucket. Drain the wort into a 5 gal carboy leaving the solids
(trub) at the bottom of the bucket. I use glass to keep characteristics from the last fermented
batch, which plastic can retain, from getting into the next batch. Add (pitch) the yeast starter and
set up a blow off tube.
Primary Fermentation: When the yeast starts work ing you'll get a bunch of foamy gack (krausen)
blowing out the tube. When the krausen subsides replace the blow off tube with an airlock. When
the airlock activity slows (one bubble in 2 seconds for ale temp, one in 6 seconds for lager temp)
use a racking tube to transfer (siphon) the stuff to a secondary fermentation carboy splashing as
little as possible to minimize oxygenation.
Secondary Fermentation: Here's where you add dr y hops for secondary, sometimes spices or
fruit. At lager temps I prepare hop pellets by boiling 16 of water, adding the pellets to the hot
water, and pouring the green goo into the secondary fermenter before racking. At low temps
pellets can float around the top like rabbit pellets and never really break up. At ale temps just toss
them in. The action of racking often adds a trace of oxygen, fermentation picks up just a little,
and/or forces some carbon dioxide out of solution, and the airlock activity may pick up a little.
I do a secondary fermentation primarily for dry hopping and to help clarify the final brew (my
beers normally have a light dusting of yeast at the bottom when finished instead of a 1/4 inch of
murk found in some homebrews). I let it set a day or two after fermentation is complete and the
hops (if I used any have settled). Rack to the bottling bucket and DON'T SPLASH - minimize
oxygenation. If I dry hop I have a fine nylon netting which I sanitize and put over the end of the
racking cane before transferring to the bottling bucket.
-----
- 289 -
Bottling: Carefully add 3/4 cup corn sugar boiled in 16 oz water to the bottling bucket and stir
without splashing with a long sanitized spoon getting agitation from top to bottom of the bucket to
ensure consistent priming. Bottle it.
Bottle Conditioning: Bottle condition, to develop carbonation and such, at the appropriate
temperature. Room temp for ale, lager temp for lager. Ales need 1 1/2 to 2 weeks (sometimes
less if you're desperate), lagers from 3 to 4 weeks.
This is my beer making ritual. I've been doing it just like this for over 3 years with never a spoiled
batch. Always drinkable, often great, and sometimes excellent results. Every experienced
homebrewer develops their own brewing rituals and preferences for ingredients and equipment.
The matter of which is better is largely subjective.

second pot. Bring to boil. Add 1 ounce of Brewers Gold to boil for 45 minutes. Add 1/2 ounce of
Northern Brewer at 30 minutes. When second pot is removed from heat, add 1/2 ounce of Saaz
hops and steep. Combine pots, cool, and pitch. I also brewed a second batch with the same
procedure, except that I used 8 pounds of honey instead of 4, 1/2 ounce of Northern Brewer hops
replaced the 1 ounce of Brewers Gold, and 1/2 ounce of Galena replaced the 1/2 ounce of

8 lbs German 2-row pils malt
.5 lbs wheat malt
.5 lbs dextrine malt
.5 lbs crystal malt (10L)
2 lbs light clover honey (boil)

Procedure I am adding the wheat malt, dextrine and crystal for body and head retention. I was
planning a two temp mash (152F & 158F) unless someone can tell me why a protein rest would
be needed. I will add two pounds light clover honey to the boil. I will also boil in 4 oz. grated
ginger root. I know it sounds like a lot, but I have used it in an extract beer with excellent results.
It's sort of toxic for the first 4 months, but after six it becomes a dry, snappy, excellent refreshing
beer.

0.5 oz Hallertauer hops pellets, finishing (steep during chilling)

Other
2 tsp gypsum

Yeast 1 pack Whitbread dry ale yeast
Procedure The chocolate malt grains were crushed and added to approximately one gallon of
water and slowly heated. Before a boil was reached, grains were removed and sparged through
two strainers, (one coarse and one medium). The malt extract, gypsum, and boiling hops were
added and boiled for 55 minutes. About 15 minutes from end of boil, yeast was rehydrated by
standard method [note: standard method consists of  removing 1 ladleful (approx. 1/4 cup) of
boiling wort and diluting to 1 cup with cold water in a sanitized 2-cup Pyrex measuring cup. It is
then cool enough to add the yeast immediately. The Pyrex cup is covered with plastic wrap,
sealed with a rubber band.] At end of boil, immersion wort chiller was placed into brewpot, the
finishing hops was added, and the brewpot was removed from the heat. The pot was immediately
transferred to the sink and the chilling begun. The brewpot lid was placed over the chiller and the
gap between pot and lid was sealed with plastic wrap. After chilling for approximately ten minutes,
the wort was transferred to the primary, straining out the hops pulp in the process. Wort was
diluted to five gallons with jug-aerated water. [Note: jug-aerated water refers to the following: cold
tap water is added to the fermenter 1/2 gallon at a time to make 5 gallons. Each 1/2 gallon is

shaken vigorously for 30 - 60 seconds in a sanitized plastic gallon jug to aerate. This may also
help dechlorinate the tap water.] Some cold tap water was blended with warm to produce a final
temperature between 65 and 70 degrees in the fermenter. The yeast was pitched immediately.
The original gravity was measured to be 1.060 at approx. 67 degrees --> 1.061 corrected.
Fermentation was carried out at approximately 62 degrees. Primary fermentation continued to 18-
Nov-92, when beer was racked to the secondary fermenter. Batch was kegged on 7-Dec-92; final
gravity: 1.015 @ 60 degrees --> 1.015 corrected. Alcohol content was computed to be 6.0375%
by volume, 4.83% by weight.

Jim's 90 Schilling Scotch Ale
Category Scottish Ale
Recipe Type All Grain
Fermentables
8 Lbs British Pale Ale Malt 2-row
1 Lb Carapils Malt
1 Lb Peated Malt
1 Lb Biscuit Malt
1 Lb 90L Crystal Malt
3 Oz Roasted Barley
1 2/3 cup gold dry malt for bottling

Hops
3 Oz Kent Goldings 5% alpha acid leaf hops
2 Oz Fuggles 4% alpha acid plug hops

Other
3 tsp Irish moss
10 Gallons artesian drinking water

Yeast #1728 WYeast Scottish ale liquid yeast
Procedure PR EPARATION: Pr epare a 2-3 quart yeast starter ahead of time. Scotch ale needs a
high pitching rate.
MASH: Use a single step infusion mash for all 12 lbs. of grain. Mill grains and add to 3 gallons
Artesian water at 180 degrees F in the mash tun. Mash should stabilize at ~158 degrees F. The
mash should be on the thick side. Hold temp at about 158 degrees F for 90 minutes for
conversion. Stir in the roasted barley about 5 minutes before sparging. Sparge with 5 gallons
water initially at 180 degrees F. This will stop conversion for the mash out. Sparge slowly for
about 45 minutes. You should get about 5.5-6.0 gallons of wort.
-----
- 322 -

BOIL: Total boil time 90 minutes. Bring to a boil rapidly and stir after 2-3 minutes. This will lig htly
carmelize the wort to enhance the flavor. Add all 5 ozs. of hops. Scotch ale does not have a flavor
or aroma hop profile. Keep a rolling boil and stir well for good hop utilization. You will lose about 1
gallon of water to evaporation. Add Irish moss about 15 minutes before the end of the boil. Cool
in cold water sink bath or wort chiller. Filter into primary fermenter and cool to 75 deg. F.
FERMENT: Pitch yeast starter. Rack to secondary after 5-8 days. Leave in secondary until
fermentation is complete. Bottle and condition at ~60 degrees F for six to eight weeks.

Strike Temperature 170 into 12 liters of treated water, alla burton on trent. Note This was a little
too thick, so use a little more water. Mashed for 45 minutes, 170 F. proteolytic step for 10
minutes. Sparged for almost two hours, while adding runoff to brew kettle to get boiling. Sparge
SG ran from 1.09 down to about 1.025 when I had enough wort. Added 3 lbs DME (Dark
Australian) to bring wort to 1.06 SG. I added 8 oz. of lactose and a tsp. of dry moss before killing
the fire.
I pitched a large starter of the Irish Wyeast strain and got lots of blow off. I had extra wort in a 4
liter auxillary. I used this to fill up the secondary afer racking off the lees. Dry hopping was done in
the secondary with the cascade. After 2 weeks, the SG was only down to 1.03, and fermentation
was very slow.

John's Raspberry Ale
Category Fruit Beers
Recipe Type Extract

Fermentables
6 lbs Williams' English Light malt extract
.5 lbs crystal malt (unknown Lovibond)
4 lbs raspberries

Hops
2 oz Hallertauer hops (4.0 AA%) (45 minutes)
.5 oz Hallertauer hops (4.0 AA%) (5 minutes)

Yeast Wyeast liquid yeast (London ale)
Procedure Prepare 1 quart starter two nights bef ore. Purchase some fresh raspberries (if
possible. Try local farmer's market). Freeze raspberries night before brewing to break down cell
walls. Pre-boil some water. Cooled some and freeze some. Prepare wort as usual by steeping
crystal malt in 150-160F water while the brew pot water is heating up and sparg into the brewpot.
Boil about an hour. Add 2 ounces Hallertau at 15 minutes and another 1/2 ounces at end of boil.
At the end of the boil, toss all the raspberries into the brewpot and let sit for fifteen minutes. Wort
was pretty cool by then. Toss *everything* into the fermenter. (With the raspberries in there, I
figured I couldn't get any S.G. readings, so I didn't try.)

.25 oz Tettnanger (3.8% alpha) (15 minute boil)
.25 oz Tettnanger (2 minute boil)

Yeast Wyeast European ale yeast
Procedure I'm assuming 80% extraction efficiency. The hop schedule broadly follows the German
method, and you can substitute Perle or Spalt, and mix and match however you want.
Following Fred Eckhardt's description of Widmer's mash sequence, mash in at 122 degrees F
and hold for 30 to 45 minutes, and then raise to 158 degrees F for starch conversion. Following
conversion, raise to 170 degrees F for mash out and hold for 10 minutes.
Primary fermentation should be done in the mid-60s. This beer benefits from cold-conditioning, so
rack to secondary and "lager" at 40 degrees for a couple weeks.

Other
1 tsp Irish moss, 20 minutes (optional)

Yeast Wyeast 1007 "German Ale" yeast - started 24 hours ahead
Procedure Bring 5 gallons of water to a boil, remove heat, dissolve malt and rice syrup solids, and
bring back to a boil. Add boiling hops and boil for 30-45 minutes. Add Irish moss. Add flavor hops
and boil for 10 more minutes, add finish hops and boil for 5 more minutes. Remove heat and cool
wort as rapidly as possible. Transfer to carboy, pitch yeast and mix/aerate vigorously. Ferment
(primary only) for ~10 days at 70-75F.
Prime with 3/4 cup (5 oz) corn sugar dissolved in 2 cups (16 oz) of boiling water, at bottling time.
Should bottle condition in 7 to 10 days.
Notes: Using a shorter boil will help keep the color light, but will decrease hops character and
protien precipitation. BE WARNED! Wyeast 1007 ferments vigorously, even volcanically. Make
sure that you have enough head space in your carboy, or use a large diameter blow off tube.

stand for 15 minutes. Cool wort to 72 degrees, strain into fermenter, and pitch yeast.
Bottling: one to two days before bottling, sour two bottles of ale. To do this, pour two bottles of ale
into a steril glass container. Cover with a clean cloth secured with string or rubber band. Put in
the cupboard (or somewhere relatively dark and warm) and let stand one to two days. It should
sour, but not mold. Add 2/3 cup corn sugar to the sour ale and boil for 10 minutes. Pour into
bottling bucket. Add sour ale and bottle as usual.

My o.g. was a little low (1.050)...I am still trying to improve my extraction eficiency :). If I were to
do this again, I would have definitely used more grain; my impression is that for a Maibock, you
want to target an o.g of around 1.060 or so.

1.5 lbs Crystal Malt
0.5 lbs Black Patent Malt

Hops
2.5 ozs Styrian Goldings Hop Pellets

Other
1 tsp Irish Moss

Yeast 2 pkgs Munton & Fison Ale Yeast
Procedure 2 cans (16 oz each) of your favorite M aple Syrup (I prefer to use "Amber" for a higher
gravity and better taste, but any grade of syrup will do; as long as it is "PURE 100% SYRUP",
NOT the "pancake syrup" junk!).
They explain to bring the grains to a boil in a gallon of water, without boiling the grains; strain, and
sparge with a quart of hot water, into the brew kettle.
Add a gallon of water to the brew kettle, and bring to a boil. At boiling, add the 2 cans (6.6 lbs) of
Munton & Fison Dark Plain Extract. Stir, don't let it stick at the bottom. Bring to a boil, add 2 oz of
the Styrian Goldings. Boil 30 minutes, add the two cans of syrup, and the teaspoon of Irish Moss.
Boil for 28 minutes more, add the remaining 1/2 oz of Styrian Goldings. Boil two more minutes,
and turn off heat.

Usual procedure for wort cooling, addition of the yeast (pre-prepared) and bottling (use 3/4 cup
corn sugar for bottling).
I chose to add the Maple syrup ONLY after 30 minutes, mostly because I was a bit worried that
the wort my overflow because of the syrup (that stuff, boiled solo, will almost always overflow!). I
was also concerned that the syrup would be "over-cooked". You may want to put it into the brew
kettle at first.
My fermentation was rather FAST, it took about 36 hours, and at that point, the air lock was only
going about once every 2 minutes. I bottled on the 10th day, to be sure.
My O.G. was 1.070, but it may vary depending on the syrup you use. My F.G. was 1.020, and
again, it may vary. I found that he color of the Porter will be mostly black, with a slight pull
towards brown.

2 lbs Gold dry malt extract (spray malt)
.5 lbs 2-row malted barley
.5 lbs Special roast barley
.5 lbs Wild rice

Hops
.5 oz Chinook hop pellets
.5 oz Willamette hop pellets

Yeast 1 pack Windsor ale yeast (Canadian)
Procedure I put all the grains into a saucepan with enough hot water to cover, and kept it hot (not
boiling) while stirring periodically for about an hour. The malted barley was supposed to supply
enough enzymes to convert the wild rice's starches into sugars. I don't know how well it worked,
but the resulting wort was amber and sweet.
I sparged it into a brewpot by dumping the grains into a colander and running a bit of hot water
through. I did recirculate once, but it was a clumsy process and I wouldn't swear that I did a
thorough job of either extracting or filtering.
I added the extracts and the boiling hops (the latter in a bag), and boiled it for a little over half an
hour, then added the aromatic hops while I prepared the fermenter. This was the first time I used

a hop bag. I don't know if it cuts down on the extraction from the pellets or not. I do know that it
cut down on the mess in the fermenter.

pitched the yeast.

is to add a hint of red color and just a touch of flavor; if you despise the taste of roasted barley
use chocolate malt instead. The toasted barley is essential. I used Wyeast Irish, but London ale

Yeast Wyeast 1007: German Ale
Procedure Using a water smoker, I smoked the cryst al and pale malt at about 170F over hickory
wood for 3-4 hours using heavy smoke. When finished, the malt smelled smokey, but didn't taste
smokey, so I took half the crystal and gave it another 3-4 hours. This smelled REALLY smokey,
but still didn't taste smokey.
-----
- 388 -
On brew day, I cracked all grains and steeped them in 3 qts. of water for 45 minutes at 150-155F.
I sparged with 1 (US) gallon of 170F water, recirculating twice (I wanted that smoke, and was
willing to get a few more tannins). I added the runoff and extracts to the kettle, and topped up to 5
and 1/2 to 6 gallons of water. I boiled 65 minutes adding the hops and Irish Moss as shown. I
calculated the IBUs to be about 30, but the finished product doesn't taste 30 IBUs worth of bitter
(maybe my calculations were off; also my crude measuring instruments mean that those
quantities on the hops are, er, approximate). Cooled with an immersion chiller and pitched the
yeast from a starter.

accordingly.

The posted recipe called for 4 pounds of dry extract with 2 cups reserved for priming. This
seemed excessive and a good way to get exploding bottles, so we reduced the amount of extract
to 3-1/2 pounds and assumed that standard priming techniques would be used, maybe replacing
corn sugar with 3/4 to 1 cup of malt extract.

Yeast Liquid Wyeast 1056 starter
Procedure Here is my smoking method with a backyard smoker. The smoker is similar to a grill,
but has a higher level for the smoking items and a tray in between the heat source and smoking
item, that holds water. The water produces steam that keeps the grain moist throughout the
smoking. I cut 1/2" pieces of wood from 2" diameter branches, then soak the wood for 20
minutes. The wood pieces ar then placed on top of hot charcoal, which produces smoke very
quick. Then the grains are placed on a stainless steel screen on the smoker rack & smoked for
about 1 hour.
(Low on hops for more smoke flavor character).
Single step Infusion Mash at 154 for 90 minutes.
Warning: This beer disappears very quickly when friends are around. For Extract batches, the
smoked & specialty grains can be steeped up to 170 for 45 min.
This should produce a beer in the 1050's for starting gravity.

Procedure Mash-in 4 gallons at 57 C (135F) strike heat.
Falls to 52C (126F). Protein rest 30 minutes.
Raise to 68C (154F),
Saccrification 2 hours.
No mashout due to brain-cloud. (You should mash out).
Sparge with 6 gallons at 75C (167F)
Got 7-1/2 ~ 7-3/4 gallons. Gravity is 1046.
Extraction = 29.7 points/#/gallon.
Boil 90 minutes.
Chill to 25C (75F). Pitch yeast.
If your extraction rates are routinely below mine, add grain accordingly in your recipe. Just add to
the two-row, don't bother to adjust the specialty malts, its just not necessary. My water is fairly
soft, and slightly alkaline. I use two tsp gypsum in my mash water. Your mileage, of course, may
vary. If you want a 1055 beer, lose 1# of two-row. But I like mine at 1060. FG was 1018. I had to
add 1/2 gallon water at bottling to bring volume up to 5 gallons.

Yeast Wyeast 1084 Irish ale yeast starter
Procedure The whole idea is to keep the protein in the beer, so you start with Pilsner malt & don't
do a protein rest. Mash using you favorite technique, but keep it short - 1hr or so. Sparge w 170 F
water (acidified). Do not recirculate excessively. The short mash and the pilsner malt will help
avoid a stuck runoff. Bring the wort to a boil as quickly as posssible. Normally I boil 30 min to
coagulate the protein before I add hops, but i in this case, add the hops right at the start of the
boil, or even before. Use Goldings. Add the so ured beer - preferably soured from a lactic
infection. Boil 1 hour, or 45 min if you used hop pellets instead of plugs. Cool & pitch Wyeast
1084 Irish ale yeast starter. SG should be 1.045-1.050 or so, unless you get spectacular
extraction rates (I don't). Ferment 60-65F.
Now if you bottle, use 3-4 oz corn sugar and let condiiton. If you keg, you've got an added
element in how you imitate guinness: Chill the beer to 50F, & turn the pressure up to 10-15 PSI &
Serve. Do not agitate the keg. The beer will have a head, but very little carbonation in the beer
itself, just like guinness.

the key to success here are:
The lightest extract you can find.

1 tbsp. Irish Moss

Yeast ale yeast
Procedure First, boil 8 lb. of well washed peeled potatoes until done. Throw out the boil water to
get rid of dirt remnants and green skin flavors. Mash to a fine consistency adding water as
necessary. Allow temperature to settle at 140 F. Add 2 oz. amylase enzyme and let sit as long as
you have patience and care to monitor the temperature. This time affects to a great extent your
conversion. It will become much thinner in consistency and sweeten. When you finally lose your
patience (3 hrs for me) add the soup to the main mash and begin your protein rest for 1/2 hr. at
122 F. Raise temperature to 152 F and mash for 2 hrs. Mash out at168 F. Now you can add the
Prerinsed rice hulls. Stir them in well, but reserve 1/2 lb. for the bottom of your lauter tun. Sparge
with pH 5.7 adjusted water. Adjust pH with either lactic acid or acid blend. Boil the wort 1 1/4 hrs.
Chill quickly. Divide wort into 2 carboys and allow to settle for about 2 hrs. or until the cold break
is well settled. Rack the wort into clean carboys, aerate well by shaking the carboys, then pitch
your yeast. Dry Munton Fison Ale yeast is excellent for this. Ferment at 68 F. When ferment is
almost done, rack to secondary adding 1 tsp. of polyclar to each carboy. Allow to settle. This
unfortunately is not sufficient to clarify the potato beer. After a week rack again and add 1 packet
of dissolved gelatin (do not boil your gelatin) and set the carboy in as cool a place as you can find
(not freezing). When clear rack into your cornelius kegs and force carbonate. And/Or bottle. Age
3 months for a very smooth mellow ale with a fain t mashed potato flavor. The hops are very nice
too.

Procedure I corona milled the grains. Cook the rye meal and oatmeal with 1 gal water 45 minutes,
ad to 2-1/2 gal strike temp water and rest of grains to achieve mash temp of ~150^F. I believe I
must have mashed higher, like 153, since I got (and would want) a dextrinous wort. I am
surprised to see from my notes that I mashed for 3 hrs., longer than I do now. I do (and did) this
by putting my kettle in the oven at 150^F. Sparged 7 gal, had a little trouble with it sticking, so I
stirred and reset it; rye will do this, but roller milled malt should help), boiled 2 hrs to 5 gal. at
1.054 SG. Didn't note whether I boiled the hops all two hrs., probably just the last hr. Tetnanger

1 oz fresh grated Ginger root
1 tsp Nutmeg

Yeast Wyeast #1056 (American Ale allege dly the same yeast used by SNBC)
Procedure Add all the spices (including Ginger root) for the last 10 minutes of the boil. OK, now
there is some controversey over exactly WHEN to add the pumpkin: the original newsletter said
to add 2 inch cubes of pumpkin to the brew-kettle 10 MINUTES before the end of the boil, and to
"ferment on" the pumpkin cubes. In the batch I made for the Dixie Cup, I put the pumpkin cubes
into the brew-kettle 30 minutes before the end of the boil. I'm not sure this was a good idea - I
think I boiled off some pumpkin crud ("crud" is a technical term) that got into the final product.
With the batch I just brewed, I am going to add mashed-up pumpkin to the secondary carboy, and
rack the contents of the primary on top of it. I used this method with excellent results on a
raspberry wheat beer recently. I also used a very different hopping schedule in my most recent
batch: 60 minutes - 3/4 oz Willamette (4.5% alpha) 30 minutes - 1/4 oz Willamette 1/2 oz
Cascades (5.5% alpha) 5 minutes - 1 1/2 oz Cascades The original recipe said to add finings to
clear. I added 1 teaspoon of Irish Moss at 60, 30 and 10 minutes before the end of the boil. I am
also considering finings or some other clarification agent in the secondary (pumpkin has got some
CLOUDY JUNK in it!).

Canned pumpkin dissolves into a horrendously fine mush that will settle to the bottom of your
primary and cause you to lose up to 1 gallon or more (it does not firmly settle out.) Are the results
worth it? I think so, but I will only do 2 or 3 pumpkin brews a year for the holidays, because it is
messy. I would think that using fresh, cooked pumpkin cut into 1" cubes or so might strain out
better, or they might break down in the mash to a consistency similar to the canned stuff. Anyone
try this.

stabilizing. Mashed at 145-155 (added 1 qt of 180F water when temp dropped to 145F).
Conversion complete in one hour. Crystal was added at mash-out. Dumped 20 qts of 180F water
into tun and stirred (mashout and batch sparge in one step). Sparge was very slow, nearly stuck
twice, so I back flushed the copper manifold to loosen it up (need to adjust my grainmill!). Start of
boil, the volume was around 32 qts. Boiled down to 22 qts. at 1.045. Points of extract = (45pts. *
5.5 gal.) / 9.75 lbs. = 25 pts/lb/gal.
Hopping schedule:
60 min: 0.50 oz MH IBU = 8.3
30 0.50 MH 4.5
0.50 Cp 5.8
10 0.50 Cp 2.5
dry 0.60 Cl 1.0 (leave on for 10 days)
----
Approximate Total IBU = 22.1 (Balanced beer at 1.045 = 20 IBU)
A note about hopping: I was attempting to get most of my IBUs later in the boil to reduce some
back of the tongue bitterness. I wanted this to be a hop flavored beer, rather than just have
bitterness to balance the malt. On most beers I try for 50-60% of the bitterness at the 60 minute
addition, but as you can see, I did not do that here. I achieved my goal I think (see tasting notes).
Full fermentation in 12 hours, high krauesen in 36 hours. Dry hops were just thrown on top of
beer in secondary.

Rasberry Pilsner

Fermentables
2 cans Ironmaster european pilsner
3-5 lbs raspberries (fresh or frozen, be sure to sterilize*)
2-4 lbs blackberries (")
DME to bring OG to 1.048

Yeast 1 tsp yeast nutrient
Procedure That's the basic recipe.. experiment with it a bit... I throw the berries on top of the wort
in primary,and let the primary go until they have leeched all their color out. At that point, I rack to
secondary and let it all settle (use finings if you feel the need, I didn't). By the time it's done, you
have a beautiful red brew that is then kegged, conditioned, and aged for 3 months in the fridge. If

you sterilised the berries right, there's not a trace of haze or cloudiness. It's almost like a
raspberry champagne, and a great dessert beer. Th e initial taste is beery, and then a lingering
fruity aftertaste. I used the pilsner kit for its relatively low hop content, allowing the fruitiness to
come out a little more.
(*) Sterilising the berries Because the berries are susceptible to wild yeast on the canes, it is
advisable to sterilise the berries by heating them in water to a point a little below 85 degrees
centigrade. (adding some dextrose to the water will start leeching out the flavor and color). Any
higer, and you will release some pectin into the solution, which will cloud the beer (not critical, it
just doens't look as cool as it does when it's crystal clear and bubbling).

Yeast Whitbread dry ale yeast
Procedure First, I smoked my malt on a barbeque grill. I built a frame out of wood and attached
aluminum window screen to it. I then started a some coals and, when they were ready, put them
in the grill with a few handfuls of wet hickory chi ps. I smoked 1 lb. of pale ale malt for 45 minutes
- 1 hour and yes it did get rather toasted by the heat, but I don't see that as a problem. I took the
gr ain off the grill before it got roasted dark becaus e I figured that would give it more of a porter-
like flavor that I was not looking for.
My notes do not include a mashing schedule, but since my temperature control in my mashing
setup isn't very good, it probably wouldn't do much good.
I used a very old package of Whitbread dry yeast as I had trouble with my Wyeast starter. It
worked out OK but I would suggest using Wyeast 1007 German Ale as I had originally intended.

and mash out for 10 minutes. Sparge with sufficient water at 165F to yield 6.5 gallons of wort. I
keep the mash temp on the high side to leave some residual roundness in the finished product,
and the Crystal give the beer a hint of sweetness.
Boil entire volume of wort for 90+ minutes, adding hops as indicated. Force chill to pitching
temperature (app. 70F). Ferment at 64-68F for 6 days in primary, then rack to secondary for 14-

Yeast Irish ale yeast
Procedure Toast the 2-row grain for 10 minues in an oven preheated at 350 before crushing.
Crush all the grain.
Put the 4 lbs of grain in a grain bag in 4 gal water. If you must use multiple bages, make sure
each bag has it's proportion of munich malt; this is where the enzymes are.
Heat the water to 160 and maintain for an hour and a half. Every 10 minutes or so wring out the
grain bag, & stir it around. This may be cut to as short as one-half hour if you use an iodine test
and it confirms conversion.
WRinge out the grain and put it into a collender (sp?), sieve, or strainer over the water. Slowly
pour another gallon (or whatever it takes to get to 5 gallons, depending upon how much you boil
off, have already boilded, etc.) of 170 degree water through it to wash off remainng sugars.
Raise to boil, add hops and extract as usual.
Steam the oak chips to sterilie them--i put a bit of water into a pan, and hold them above in a
strainer with a lid over it for about 10 minutes.

2.5 tsp Burton water salts
-----
- 506 -
1 tsp Irish Moss

Yeast 2 pkgs Nottingham English Ale Yeast
Procedure Bring cracked crystal malt just to the boil in approx. 2 litres of water. Strain this "tea"
into your boiling pot, discarding the grains. Stir the dry malt into about 2 litres cold water to
dissolve. Mix the dissolved malt, Cascade hops, and Burton water salts into the "crystal malt tea".
Boil for 1 hour. In the last 15 minutes of the boil, add the Irish moss. In the last 5 minutes, add the
Willamette hops. Transfer immediately (through a strainer) into your primary fermentor containing
2-3 gallons of cold water. Top up with cold water to 23L (5 gal) mark. Check the temperature and
pitch yeast when ready (68-70F, 20-23C). Ferment  at about 68F until the foam subsides, usually
3-4 days. Rack to a secondary fermentor. Check the gravity in about 1 week. When the readings
are stable for 2-3 days, you are ready to bottle. Mix the 1 1/2 cups dry malt in 1 1/2 cups cold
water. Bring to a boil, then stir into the beer as you rack it into another container just prior to
bottling. Bottle and leave to condition at room temperature for 1-2 weeks, then store in a dark cool
place for a few more weeks, or until it tastes right to you.

1 campden tablet
.5 cup corn sugar to prime

Yeast 1 pack Edme ale yeast (11.5g)
Procedure Brought 2--1/2 gallons water to boil with crystal malt in grain bag (removed grain bag
when water was at 170 F). Added extract and brought to boil, boiled for 60 minutes. All of hops
for 45 minutes.
Chilled wort to ~100 F and strained into carboy (prefilled with 2--1/2 gallons cold water).
Rehydrated yeast in 90 F water for 15 minutes and pitched, topped off carboy with water, and
mounted blowoff tube.
After two days of healthy ferment (~75 F) added fruit. Pureed raspber- ries with campden tablet,
added to fresh carboy (better use a 6 or 7 gallon car boy if you got it, the fruit takes up space!),
purged carboy with CO2, and racked beer into it. Swirled it around a little to mix it up (don't shake
it up) and put blowoff tube back on. Let sit another week and bottle. I only used 1/2 cup corn
sugar to prime, and it was plenty. Didn't take a final gravity.

1 tsp Irish moss (rehydrated, 15 min boil)

Yeast Wyeast 1338 (european ale 1 qt starter)
Procedure - mashed all the grains in 4 qts of 156F water for 1 hr
- sparged with 4 qts of 170F water
- SG of runnings: 1.036 in ~7 qts
- added LME, made volume up to 3 gal, boiled for 1 hr
- chilled with immersion chiller, aerated, made volume up to 5 gal, aerated some more, pitched 1
qt starter
- fermented at 65 - 68F
I use a grain bag from Williams Brewing (800-759-6025) that is made to fit inside a bucket type
lauter tun. It also fits perfectly inside my 3 gallon SS kettle.
To do the mash on my stove, I just heat up the mash water to ~165F (in my kettle) then drop in
the grain bag containing the crushed grains. Stir real well, let it sit for a minute, then check the
temp. If its to low (which it will be) either add small amounts of boiling water (1 cup at a time, stir,
let it sit for a minute, then check the temp) or add heat with the stove burner on medium heat
while gently stirring constantly. After you hit the mash temp, cover it up and let it sit for 1 hour. At
the end of the 1 hour, I lift the grain bag just above the surface of the wort and sparge by pouring
the sparge water over the grains gently with a measuring cup.
As you can see, my mash setup/technique is pretty simple and does'nt require a lot of extra
equipment. I'm not trying to get the max possible extr action from the grains, only the flavor/body
that was missing before I started doing these partial mashes.
Since this setup/technique produces wort that is rather cloudy with grain particles, I've often
wondered if it will lead to some astringency in the finished beer. Some of the judges comments
(see below) lead me to believe that this does happen. Kirk Fleming asked about this in HBD
#1968. Does this stovetop mashing sound similar to what you do?

Yeast 500 ml Starter of WYeast 1056
Procedure Mashed the pale ale malt and crystal in 13 quarts treated (i.e. boiled) water at 150 F
for 1.5 hr in a 10 gal Gott with a Phils Phalse Bottom.
Sparged with 4+ gal acidified (1/8 tsp "acid blend") to pH = 5.5 water at 170 F. Sparged to 6.5 gal.
The gravity at 6.5 gal was 1053. This implies:
(53 pts) X (6.5gal) / 10.5 lbs  =  32.8 pts/lb/gal !
When boiled to 5.5 gal and racked to primary that yields an OG of 62.6. What should I call this
stuff? Sierra Nevada Potent Ale?
Anyway, the mash went very well. The temperatur e drop was only two degrees over the 1.5 hrs (I
preheated the Gott). Now sparging, that is another story. I was somewhat overwhelmed by the
sparging: I kept drawing off wort and recirculating it but it never seemed to clear the way I
expected it. I finally said to hell with it and ran off the initial wort and proceded to sparge with
water to 6.5 gal. There was still good sugar in the sparge at this point.

various types of hop pellets to taste.

Yeast
Procedure I start with half a preserving kettle of water and when that is boiling I dissolve the
sugar therein. If I don't forget, I usually add the hops  first. Next I pour in the three cans of malt
stirring as I do so. When this mix is about to return to a boil I shut off the heat. I then put the mix
in a clean hard finish, plastic garbage pail (I thought that might get to some of you.), and add
sufficient water to make the 14 doz. bottles.
The whole thing is then set on a wooden case about a foot high with a light bulb under it.
(40watts) I then cover the lot with a heavy quilt and leave it alone for 7 or 8 days. After that I
check with the Hydrometer to see if the SP is up to about 1.0. If it is I bottle it using a plastic
syphon.
I prefer not to drink any of this for at least a month, preferably longer, but then I have about 45
doz. bottles at my disposal. There is a certain am ount of sediment in the bottles but if you pour
carefully it comes out crystal clear. There is no taste to the sediment anyway and I have drank it
straight out of the bottle on occasion. Cheers.

Procedure Notes: I sour 1/2 (one half) of the mash, the high % wheat half, the other is straight
infusion. I do how ever make a effort to minimize heat loss by using a ice chest and sealing the lid
with duct tape. If it smells rotten, it is OK. The bacteria at work are for the most part aerobic. If it
looks bad, it's OK. After 14 hours no matter how bad you think you screwed up, its OK just see
the thing thru, it is worth it.
Combine mashes for mash out @ 170F for 15 min. Sparge @ 170F. Boil for 75 minutes, then
cool and split into two carboys. Pitch a Chimay culture into one and a Chico ale yeast into the
other. Add 1/4 ounce freshly crushed coriander to each. After 7 days fermentation, blend the two
batches together in a larger vessel. Ferment 7 days longer. Keg with 1/4 cup corn sugar per 5
gallons. Counter pressure bottled after 2 weeks.

Mash: 60 min. @ 150-156 F pH 5.2
Mash out: 15 min. @ 170F

end.
I used the theoretical values in Miller's CHoHB, and the SG points avail- able from the grain bill
were 290. Multiply 58 by 5 and be amazed as I was! Yes, I got 100% of theoretical extraction, and
only sparged 5 gal.! How? I'll describe my sparge procedure this time, because I believe herein
lies the key.
For lautering, I use the bucket in bucket tun. I'd suspect that it's the same as many other brewers
use. It isn't insulated, or anything fancy. Sparge water was acidified with lactic acid ala Miller .
Here's the difference. I recirculated the initial runoff for the equivalent of 6 gal. Then I began the
sparge with 1/2 of the water heated to 170F and recirculated it once. I finished up with the last 2.5
gal., which was also recirculated once. Total sparge time was about 2.5 hours. The sparge was a
good bit longer than usual, but those results!!! The runoff was reheated between recirculations,
BTW. The last runnings had no preceivable tannic taste.

6 each Chinese (Szechwan?) chiles
8 each chiles used for dry spicing (6 steamed, 2 unsteamed)

Yeast 1 pkg Yeast Lab Whitbread Ale Yeast
Procedure Removed stems and seed from chiles. Boil ed extract and hops in ~3 gallons of water
for 1 hour. Steeped chiles from 10 minutes, then discarded them. Started yeast in a small yeast
starter. Pitched when wort cooled (I don't have a wort chiller). Bottled approx. 10 days later with
priming sugar.
Before bottling I used a wine thief to taste the beer. Since the heat from the chile was low I
decided to steam a few chiles and "dry spice" in the bottle. I also made two bottles with
unsteamed chiles.
I'm not going to throw the chiles in the brew pot again. Very little spice was contributed from the
six chiles I steeped.
I'll not put one chile in each bottle again, either. Fortunately, I limited this to 8 beers. The steamed
chiles made the brew overpowering. The unsteamed chiles were worse, with a mild infection that
caused those beers to become hazy. The problem is not the heat. The dry spiced bottles are
about as hot as Pace hot salsa. It's the chile aroma that makes the beer undrinkable.
My next attempt will utilize dry spicing in the fermenter. I'll try 6 to 8 steamed chiles in a musslin
bag. Also, I'll put more hops in the boil (1.5 oz of similar bittering hops). The chiles seem to
provide heat and aroma, which leaves flavor wide open to bittering.

enough to fit 'em). Cooled them and my wort and added the rest of the water. Pithced the yeast.
The blowoff was amazing! (I probably lost about 1 1/2 gallons of beer). Tons of it. I heated the
pectin enzyme in a little water and added it to the secondary (to eliminate pectin haze). Let it sit in
a secondary for three weeks. When I bottled it it tasted tart as hell -- but a week later I started
drinking it and it was great! It's a bit bitter, but the strawberry is very noticeable and everyone
seems to enjoy it (especially me!).

Yeast Wyeast #1214 Belgian ale yeast
Procedure I used two 8 quart stockpots to cook this. I boiled one full pot of water, and set the
seive in the top with the crystal malt after I cut the heat. Waited 20 minutes, then took the seive
out and threw out the grains. I split the "tea" between the two pots, filled with water and started
the boil. I added the extract and Saaz, boiled for 30 minutes, added the Fuggles, and boiled for
30 minutes more. I cooled the 4 gallons to 75 degrees and pitched the yeast. Then I boiled (!) the
strawberries with 1 gallon of water for 15 minutes, then cooled and racked the beer (lost some
trub here) onto the strawberry mix. 4 hours later, I racked the mix again, losing all of the trub (so
far). Primary fermentation was outrageous! With 5+ inches headroom in my primary, I blew the
Saran Wrap up 3 inches, then off 3 times! 3 days in the primary, then I racked to the secondary,
and added the pectin enzyme. After 8 days in the secondary, I bottled with 1 1/2 cups of dried
extract. I stored it for 3 weeks, then tried it.

temperature probe and it's hold temp feature for the two conversion rests, and mash out to 170F.
I used MedHigh power, and stirred every 10 minutes or so. The emphasis in mashing was on
body, not fermentable sugar. It worked. The beer has considerably more malt flavor, body, and
the dry hopping gave it a bit more tang than it usually has. Old recipe just used 1/2 pound of
malted wheat, cold to boil, to add a bit of flavor.

Procedure I measured the OG at 1026, although in hindsight I think the brew was still a little
warm. . . . Let's call it 1035 or so.I put this in my fridge (42 F) on 9 December, in hopes that it
would be finished by the time I got back from Xmas break. It certainly wasn't! On 16 January I
measured the specific gravity at 1021, and it was still pretty sweet. On 8 February, though I knew
that it was not done fermenting, I bottled with 1/2 cup corn sugar and put all the bottles back in
my fridge. A day later, I decided to move two bottles into my pantry, to see if anything interesting
would happen.

Yeast Wyeast #1056 American Ale Yeast
Procedure Don't boil the grains, just crush them and steep them in 2 gallons of 170F water, then
remove and add the rest of the 5.5 gallon boil water. If you don't do a full wort boil, you will have
to increase the hop rates (say, 25% more for a 2.75 gallon boil) to compensate for the lower
efficiency. Better be very sure you keep good sanitation since lactobacillus can eat the lactose
and will certainly make for gushers (or worse) if you get an infection.
Fermented at 68F.

Yeast Lager Yeast (please use something good!)
Procedure Well, here goes... keep it simple and fun! Before you start... why not get your yeast
starter going?
Crack the crystal in a blender or whatever you like to crack with (dont powderize it!) bring it to a
boil with one gallon of cold water. At the first sign of a boil, strain the liquid into your normal
boiling pot (dont squeeze, smish, or squish the grain... just let the wort run out).
Add one gallon (or two if the pot is large enough) of water, the water salts, and extracts to the pot
and bring to a boil. Boil for fifteen minutes, then add the boiling hops and continue boiling for 30
minutes (keep on stirring, but try to keep the pot covered as much as possible).
Add the Irish moss, stir for one minute.
Add the finishing hops. Stir and cover for three minutes.
Place (chill first if you like) in the fermenter and top to 5.5 gallons.
Pitch when cool (as if you didnt know this part).
I normally use a two stage system. I'll rack it once after the head falls. When the bubbler pharts 2
or less times per minute, i'll bottle or keg. If you are bottling, i would suggest using somewhere
between 1/2 and 3/4 cup corn sugar, or 1/2 cup of honey for priming... I hope i didnt forget
anything...
Note: If you serve this beer to newbies or wimps, serve it COLD!

Procedure Cracked grains and steeped in 2 (U.S.) quarts 150-155F water for 45 minutes.
Collected runoff and sparged with an additional 1--1/2 gallons 170F water. Added to brew kettle
with enough additional water to make 5- -1/2 gallons. Dissolved extract and boiled 65 minutes,
adding hops and Irish Moss as shown. Chilled with an immersion chiller down to 70F. Racked off
break and pitched onto dregs of the secondary of a previous batch, a la Father Barleywine. Active
fermentation in under 12 hours. O.G. = 1.056; IBU = approximately 33 (not counting the dry
hopping which would have added a point or two). Single-stage blowoff fermentation in the low
70's. Primary was 4 days, after which I attached a fermentation lock and dumped in the dry-
hopping hops. After another 19 days of secondary, I racked to a Cornelius keg primed with 1/2
cup of corn sugar. After waiting a week or so , I tapped, keeping 20 psi on the keg at all other

Actual boil time:75Min. So I initially had no intention of putting the brown sugar in or the cinamon,
but when i racked to the secondary they yeast had attenuated so well in 7days, i figured id give
them something else to do, as they were almost done, and surely getting bored. Early on, it had a
very phenolic nose. Granted it was flat and 70. After that, the Special B really shined through with
good plum and a little bannana. NOthing too special... yet, but its only been 18days. we'll see
what comes. The orange and Corriander are there, but just barely, i didnt use a lot considering

Procedure Crushed and steeped carapils. >30 min @130F, 150F, 170F. Sparged, increased
volume to almost 4 gallons, heated and stirred in malt powder. Added hops in 4 portions after boil
began, about every 15 minutes until they were all in - boiled another 45 minutes after last
addition. Turned off heat, stirred in coriander seed, orange peel and cloves, started the chiller
about 2-3 minutes later. Siphoned into carboy , added water to about 5 gallons, pitched yeast
directly and shook to aereate. Wort didn't taste unduly strange, kind of hoppy, not too spicy.
After secondary fermentation was complete I decided it should be hoppier and added the 2nd oz.
of hallertau pellets. 3 days later I reconsidered and racked off the hops. I further decided to test
out the scrubbing bubbles theory of hops reduction - I boiled 1 cup of corn sugar and steeped
another tsp orange peel and added it - got a fairly vigorous fermentation for several more days.

Yeast Belgian ale yeast (Wyeast 1214)
Procedure Boil 2-1/2 gallons of water, add malt extract and boiling hops, and boil for 55-60
minutes. Turn off heat, add finishing hops, cool to 190 F and add the frozen fruit and vanilla. Let
sit covered for 20 minutes, maintaining temperature at about 170 F and stirring occasionally. Cool
to below 100F, add to carboy pre-filled with 2-1/2 gallons of water, straining out and pressing the
fruit to extract most of the juice. Pitch the y east, ferment at 70-72F, transfer to secondary after
two days, then ferment completely out (about another 7 days). Prime with 3/4 cup corn sugar and
bottle.
24 oz of raspberries gives a fairly subtle beer, with a mild tart raspberry underpinning that all of
my friends loved. 36 oz of berries give a more assertive, but not overwhelming, raspberry flavor.
Note that Belgian ale yeast will give stronger "clove" overtones when fermented at temperatures
of 75-78F, and milder flavors at 70-72F.

Procedure The O.G. on my batch was a healthy 1.065, but as you probably have guessed...the
final gravity wasn't anywhere near 0...which was good. It is the adjuncts and unfermentables in
this batch that give it that special holiday/winter character. I will definanely try this batch
again...but before next winter!

Yeast Wyeast #1056 American Ale Yeast
Procedure Let the initial primary fermentation go for a couple of days, I usually dump the wort into
a plastic bucket filled with cold water and get just about the right temp as well as a great cold
break. I let this sit for about an hour and rack to a 5 gallon carboy (to get rid of all the trub) and
then pitch my starter and relax...
After primary rack (without splashing!) to a secondary and add dry-hops. You can either use a
hop bag or just throw them in. I have not had any trouble siphoning off for bottling with that little
orange plug they give you with the racking tube. Let this go 1-2 weeks at about 65-68 degrees.
Bottle.
It should be drinkable after a week or two, but if you can hold out for 4-6 you will have a
magnificent brew...
Use a yeast starter for best results!

Category Belgian Ale
Recipe Type Partial Mash

Fermentables
4 lbs DeWolf-Cosyns "Pils" malt
3 lbs flaked (unmalted) wheat (cracked wheat works fine)
6 oz rolled oats
1 cup corn sugar (priming)

Hops
1 oz Saaz hops (3.2% AA)
-----
- 635 -

Other
1 oz bitter Curacao orange peel
.75 oz sweet orange or tangerine peel
.75 oz fresh ground coriander seed
.5 oz fresh ground anise seed
A pinch of ground cumin
10 ml 88% food-grade lactic acid (at bottling)

Yeast BrewTek "Belgian Wheat" yeast
Procedure Dough-in grains with 3 gallons of soft water at ~90F. Protein rests:
30 minutes @ 117F
30 minutes @ 122F
30 minutes @ 126F (at this point, the wheat appears dissolved)
Pull first decoction; thickest third of the mash
Heat decoction to 160F, rest 15 minutes
Heat decoction to boiling, boil 15 minutes
Return boiling decoction to rest mash and stir.
Mash temperature should be near 145F. Rest 15 minutes.
Pull second decoction; thickest third of the mash
Heat decoction to 160F, rest 10 minutes
Heat decoction to boiling, boil 10 minutes
Return boiling decoction to rest mash and stir.
Mash temperature should be near 162F. Rest 15 minutes.
Check starch. If not converted, rest longer.
Mash-out: 10 minutes @ 170F
Sparge: 5 gallons @ 170F
Boil 60 minutes, adding hops at the beginning. Spices are added in the last 10 minutes of the boil
or at knockout. I used a single- stage ferment (as I usually do). OG: 1.038. TG: 1.002.
Adding the lactic acid rather than biologically souring the beer is definitely a shortcut, and one
that adds time to the processing, as it takes longer  after bottling for the flavors to "marry" than for
conditioning to develop. If you have a lactobacillus culture in your possession that will do the job,
have at it.
